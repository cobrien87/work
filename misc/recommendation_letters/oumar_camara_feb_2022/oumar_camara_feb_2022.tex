\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I'm writing this letter to strongly recommend  \textbf{Oumar Camara} for admission to your program.  I've gotten to know Oumar this year, where he's been a student in my    introductory computer science course.  This class introduces  the basic concepts of computer science using the programming language Python.   

Oumar has shown real ability with mastering basic concepts of programming and computer science.  He assimilates the material, asks questions, and helps other students also master the material.  He ended last semester with a B+, which is impressive given a period of extended absence due to Covid.   Furthermore, I've been impressed with Oumar's demeanor in class: friendly, respectful, and always ready to get down to work.  

I was happy when Oumar told me he plans to major in computer science in college.  Having worked with Oumar this year, I can confidently predicted that he has the diligence and academic skills  to  excel in all his undergraduate studies, but especially in computer science.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
