\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I'm writing this letter to strongly recommend  \textbf{Nasir Nasir} for admission to your program.  I first got to know Nasir in my geometry course in the 2018-2019 school year. Though only in 9th grade,  he  demonstrated real curiosity about the subject and asking probing questions that drove the mathematical understanding of the whole class forward. This was matched by consistent hard work and diligence on classwork, homework, and exams. He ended the first semester of the class with a 90\% and the second semester with an 85\%.  

I've also had the pleasure to teach Nasir this semester in my  introductory computer science course.  This class introduces  the basic concepts of computer science using the programming language Python.    This class has further revealed Nasir's ability to work hard, contribute productively to in-class discussions, and master academic material.  He currently has a 94\%.    

In short, having worked with Nasir in a variety of classes over several years, I can confidently predicted that he has the diligence and academic skills  to  excel in his undergraduate studies.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
