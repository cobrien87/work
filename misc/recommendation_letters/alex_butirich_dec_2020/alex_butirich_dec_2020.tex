\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I'm writing this letter to strongly recommend  \textbf{Alexandra Butirich} for admission into your program.  I first got to know Alexandra in my Science of Language course. As an introduction to formal linguistics--a topic not normally taught to high school students--this course contains a great deal of challenging material. Nonetheless, Alexandra demonstrated real hard work and diligence in the class: She completed her classwork and homework regularly, asked probing  questions that drove the understanding of the whole class forward, and ended the course with a 96\%.  

I've also had Alexandra in Geometry  and a Computer Science class I'm currently teaching.    Both classes have further revealed Alexandra's ability to work hard, contribute productively to in-class discussions, and master academic material in a variety of subjects.  This school year, despite its numerous disruptions, hasn't diminished any of these qualities.   In short, having worked with Alexandra in a variety of classes over several years, I can confidently predicted that she has the diligence and academic skills  to  excel in her undergraduate studies.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
