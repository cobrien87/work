\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I'm writing this letter to strongly recommend  \textbf{Shianna Nichols} for admission into your program.  I first got to know Shianna in my introductory computer science course when she was in 9th grade.  This class introduces  the basic concepts of computer science and programming. Shianna demonstrated real hard work and diligence in the class: She completed her classwork and homework regularly, asked probing  questions that drove the understanding of the whole class forward, and ended the first semester with a 96\% and the second semester with a 100\%. 

I've also enjoyed getting to work with Shianna again this year in my precalculus class.  Many students struggled with the transition back to in person learning, after nearly two years remote. But Shianna has demonstrated a great attitude and the same academic skills I saw her freshman year.  This class has  further revealed Shianna's ability to work hard, contribute productively to in-class discussions, and master academic material.  

 In short, having worked with Shianna in a variety of classes over several years, I can confidently predicted that she has the diligence and academic skills  to  excel in her undergraduate studies.



\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
