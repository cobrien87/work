\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I'm writing this letter to strongly recommend  \textbf{Rafiki Holder} for admission to your program.  I first got to know Rafiki in my geometry course in the 2018-2019 school year. Though only in 9th grade,  he  demonstrated real curiosity about the subject and made a genuine effort to deeply understand  the mathematics he was learning. This was matched by consistent hard work and diligence on classwork, homework, and exams. He ended the first semester of the class with a  grade 100\% and the second semester with a 96\%.  

I've also had the pleasure to teach Rafiki this school year in my  AP Computer Science A course.  In this class students prepare for the AP exam and are introduced to the basics of object-oriented programming using the Java programming language.  By no means an easy subject to master, this class has further revealed Rafiki's ability to work hard, contribute productively to in-class discussions, and master academic material.  He finished last semester with an A.

In short, having worked with Rafiki in a variety of classes over several years, I can confidently predict that he has the diligence and academic skills  to  excel in his undergraduate studies.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
