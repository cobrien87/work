\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I'm writing this letter to strongly recommend  \textbf{Ragib Ratul} for admission into your program.  
I first got to know Ragib in my Geometry class, where it was my pleasure to watch him blossom as a student. Initially he was  shy and withdrawn, rarely participating willingly.
However, by the end of the school year Ragib was not only participating in class on a regular basis, he was demonstrating real curiosity about the subject and asking probing questions that drove the mathematical understanding of the whole class forward. This  was matched by consistent hard work and diligence on classwork, homework, and exams. This increased participation and effort was reflected in his grades: from 80\% in the first semester to 91\% by the end of the school year.

I also had a chance to work with Ragib last school year when he joined the Lehman Computer Science Club, which I supervise.   Ragib proved to be a leader in the club.  He helped code the Club's website, and also shared with us  what he was  independently learning about such numerous Computer Science related topics, such as the programming language C++.  Given all this, I was not surprised when he told me he planned on studying computer science, a field I'm confident he will excel in.

In short, I have found Ragib to be  an industrious student who I know has the enthusiasm and drive to succeed in his undergraduate studies.    


\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
